O transient voyager of heaven!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O silent sign of winter skies!<br/> 
What adverse wind thy sail has driven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To dungeons where a prisoner lies?

Methinks ==the hands that shut the sun=={Q8074} <br/>
⁠&nbsp;&nbsp;So sternly from this morning's brow<br/>
Might still their rebel task have done<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And checked a thing so frail as thou.<br/>

They would have done it had they known<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The talisman that dwelt in thee,<br/>
For all the suns that ever shone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have never been so kind to me!<br/>

For many a week, and many a day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart was weighed with sinking gloom<br/>
When morning rose in ==mourning grey=={Q2450206}<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And faintly lit my prison room<br/>

But angel like, when I awoke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy silvery form, so soft and fair<br/>
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cloudy skies and mountains bare;<br/>

The dearest to a ==mountaineer=={flyto=Q513}<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, all life long has loved ==the snow=={flyto=Q6395256}<br/>
That crowned his ==native summits=={flyto=Q7296} drear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;⁠Better, than ==greenest plains=={flyto=Q1558} below.<br/>

And voiceless, soulless, messenger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy presence waked a thrilling tone<br/>
That comforts me while thou art here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;⁠And will sustain when thou art gone<br/>
